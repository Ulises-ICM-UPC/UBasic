    "`UBasic` is an open source software written in Python for manual image calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The program is aimed to obtain the image calibration from a set of Ground Control Points (GCP) and, optionally, the Horizon Points (HP). The result of the process is the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for each individual image. In addition, planviews can be generated for each image. A code to verify the quality of the GCPs used in the manual calibration of the images is also provided. The development of this software is suitable for images from any source, in particular from Argus-type video monitoring stations or drones. Details about the algorithm and methodology are described in\n",
